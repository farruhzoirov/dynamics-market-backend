## About This Project

This project is a scalable backend application built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), designed to support modern business requirements with robust integrations and advanced features.

### Key Technologies & Features

- **NestJS**: Utilized as the main framework for building efficient, modular, and maintainable server-side applications in TypeScript.
- **MongoDB**: Used as the primary database for storing and managing application data, leveraging its flexibility and scalability.
- **Redis**: Integrated for caching and session management to improve performance and handle real-time data efficiently.
- **Docker**: The entire application stack, including dependencies, is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and consistent environments.
- **Elasticsearch**: Implemented for advanced search capabilities, enabling fast and flexible full-text search across the application data.
- **Category Hierarchies**: Developed a hierarchical category system, allowing categories and subcategories to be managed and queried efficiently.
- **AmoCRM Integration**: Integrated with AmoCRM to synchronize leads, contacts, and other CRM data, enabling seamless business process automation.
